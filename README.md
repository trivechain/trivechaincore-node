Bitcore Node Dash
============

A Dash full node for building applications and services with Node.js. A node is extensible and can be configured to run additional services. At the minimum a node has an interface to [Dash Core v0.12.1.x](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/tree/v0.12.1.x) for more advanced address queries. Additional services can be enabled to make a node more useful such as exposing new APIs, running a block explorer and wallet service.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g bitcore-node-dash
```

## Prerequisites

- Dash Core (v0.12.1.x) with support for additional indexing *(see above)*
- Node.js v0.10, v0.12, v4 or v5
- ZeroMQ *(libzmq3-dev for Ubuntu/Debian or zeromq on OSX)*
- ~20GB of disk storage
- ~1GB of RAM

## Configuration

Bitcore includes a Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing, configuring and interfacing with your Bitcore Node.

```bash
bitcore-node-dash create -d <dash-data-dir> mynode
cd mynode
bitcore-node-dash install <service>
bitcore-node-dash install https://github.com/yourname/helloworld
bitcore-node-dash start
```

This will create a directory with configuration files for your node and install the necessary dependencies.

Please note that [Dash Core v0.12.1.x](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/tree/v0.12.1.x) will be downloaded automatically. Once completed the dashd binary should be placed into the &lt;dash-data-dir&gt; folder specified during node creation.

For more information about (and developing) services, please see the [Service Documentation](docs/services.md).
